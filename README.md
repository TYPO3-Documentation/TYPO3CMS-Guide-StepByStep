# TYPO3 Step-by-Step Guides

Welcome to the official TYPO3 Step-by-Step Guide repository — a growing library of practical, hands-on tutorials for TYPO3 users of all levels.

These guides help learners complete **one focused task at a time** in a reliable, repeatable way. Whether you're new to TYPO3 or helping others get started, this is the place to find or contribute learner-first documentation.

## 🧭 Why Step-by-Step Guides?

Step-by-step guides are designed for **learning by doing**. Each one:

- Focuses on a single task
- Follows one clear path — no forks or gotchas
- Keeps explanations minimal and actionable
- Produces a visible, successful outcome
- Takes less than 30 minutes to complete

## ✍️ Want to Contribute?

We welcome contributions from TYPO3 users of all backgrounds — editors, integrators, developers, and beyond.

👉 To get started:
1. Read the [Contributor Guide](Documentation/90Contribute/20ContributorGuide/Index.md).
2. Copy the [Template](Documentation/90Contribute/10Template/Index.md).
3. Add your guide to the right folder (see [How to Place Guides in the Registry Structure](Documentation/90Contribute/30UnderstandingTheStructure/20PlaceGuidesInTheStructure.md) for help).
4. Open a Pull Request — or ask for help in your draft!


## 🔧 Requirements

To write or test a guide, you’ll need:
