 **Tested in:** [TYPO3v13](/Tags/TYPO3v13.md) **Categories:** [Intermediary](/Tags/Intermediary.md) [Backend](/Tags/Backend.md) [Editing](/Tags/Editing.md) **Author:** [@mabolek](https://my.typo3.org/u/mabolek)

All official TYPO3 teams and committees have a page at [typo3.community](https://typo3.community). This page is used to explain what the team or committee is, how they function, and to display the team members and their roles. Team and committee leads can edit their pages through the TYPO3 backend.

## Learning objective

In this step-by-step guide you will edit the page of a team or committee through the TYPO3 backend.

## Prerequisites

### Tools and technology

* Access to a TYPO3 backend (editor or admin account)
* A web browser

### Knowledge and skills

* You know how to *Log in to the TYPO3 backend* [(CREATE)](https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-StepByStep/new/contrib/Documentation/00Incoming?filename=LogInToTheTYPO3Backend.md&value=Copy%20content%20the%20template%20from%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FTYPO3-Documentation%2FTYPO3CMS-Guide-StepByStep%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fcontrib%2FDocumentation%2F90Contribute%2F10Template%2FIndex.md "Create this missing step-by-step guide")
* You know how to [Modify the Page Properties](/10GettingStarted/20BasicConfiguration/10BackendBasics/ModifyingThePageProperties.md)

## Access the page properties

All of the editable page content for a basic team or committee page is stored in the Page record, so you will not have to edit content elements.

1. Log in to the typo3.community backend at [typo3.community/typo3](https://typo3.community/typo3/) as explained in *Log in to the TYPO3 backend* [(CREATE)](https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-StepByStep/new/contrib/Documentation/00Incoming?filename=LogInToTheTYPO3Backend.md&value=Copy%20content%20the%20template%20from%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FTYPO3-Documentation%2FTYPO3CMS-Guide-StepByStep%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fcontrib%2FDocumentation%2F90Contribute%2F10Template%2FIndex.md "Create this missing step-by-step guide"). You should see your team or committee’s page in the page tree with an orange icon (![A file icon with a white TYPO3 logo on an orange background with a folded corner in the top right.](Images/EditATeamOrCommitteePage/GroupPageIcon.png)).
2. Access the page’s page properties as explained in [Modify the Page Properties](/10GettingStarted/20BasicConfiguration/10BackendBasics/ModifyingThePageProperties.md).

## Modify the page content in the page properties

1. Make sure the *Group configuration* tab is selected. It should look something like this:
