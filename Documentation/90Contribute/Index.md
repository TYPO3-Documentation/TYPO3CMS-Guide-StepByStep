# 📝 Contribute a Step-by-Step Guide

We’re building a library of hands-on, task-focused tutorials to help learners succeed with TYPO3 — and we’d love your help!

This section explains how to contribute a guide to the TYPO3 Step-by-Step project. Whether you're documenting your favorite workflow or covering a commonly requested feature, you’ll use a shared structure that keeps things clear and consistent for learners.

You’ll find:
- The official writing template
- A detailed contributor guide that walks you through every section

We follow a “single path to success” philosophy. Every guide shows one clear method to complete one task — no branches, no gotchas, no assumptions. If your task is part of a bigger process, you can also write a project guide that links multiple tutorials together.
