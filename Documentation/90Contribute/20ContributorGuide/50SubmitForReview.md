# Submit for Review

## Minimum requirements

All TYPO3 Step-by-Step Guides must include the following required sections:

* **Title** — Starts with a verb and reflects the overall learning objective
* **Conceptual overview** — Follows the title directly (no heading), uses plain language, and stays under \~100 words
* **Learning objective** — Describes what the learner will achieve by completing the guide
* **Prerequisites** — Lists required software, tools, environments, and any conceptual knowledge
* **Task section**
  * Includes at least one task with numbered steps
  * Each step begins with a verb and describes one action
  * Each task includes at least one expected outcome
* **Summary** — Recaps what has been achieved
* **Next steps** — Suggests logical follow-on tasks

The following sections are optional but strongly encouraged:

* **Resources** — Links to supporting material
* **Video** — Embedded video version of the guide (from the official TYPO3 YouTube channel)

Use the [template](../10Template/Index.md) and [writing instructions](30UsingTheTemplate.md) to complete each section.

All required sections must be complete and free of placeholders like “TBD.”

Every guide will have room for improvement — that’s expected. That’s why all TYPO3 step-by-step guides include a feedback section to collect reader-reported gaps and issues.
