# Enabling and disabling a page in the page tree

<!-- #TYPO3v13 #Beginner #Backend #Editing #PageTree @mabolek -->

TYPO3 allows you to disable pages. Disabled pages are inaccessible to frontend website visitors, but you can still edit the pages in the backend. Depending on your TYPO3 configuration all pages that you create may be disabled by default. They will need to be enabled in order to be published on your website.

*In the above screenshot the "Features" page is disabled, indicated by the overlaid red-and-white "no entry" sign on the page's icon. The "Customize" page is enabled and has a normal page icon.*

## Learning objective

In this step-by-step guide you will disable and enable a page using the contextual menu in the TYPO3 page tree.

## Prerequisites

### Tools and technology

* Backend access to a TYPO3 installation

### Knowledge and skills

* [Basic knowledge of the TYPO3 backend](https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:backend)

## Disable a page

In this step, we will disable a page in the page tree.

1. In the page tree, choose a page that you would like to disable. The page must not be disabled already.
2. Click on the page icon or right-click on the page name to bring up the context menu.
3. From the context menu, choose "Disable".

The disabled page will now have a red-and-white "no entry" sign on the page's icon, as shown in the screenshot at the top of the page.

## Enable a page

In this step, we will enable the disabled page again.

1. In the page tree, find the page you disabled previously.
2. Click on the page icon or right-click on the page name to bring up the context menu.
3. From the context menu, choose "Enable".

## Summary

You have now disabled and re-enabled a page using the context menu of TYPO3's page tree.
