# TYPO3 Step-by-Step Guides

Welcome to the official TYPO3 Step-by-Step Guide repository — a growing library of practical, hands-on tutorials for TYPO3 users of all levels.

These guides help learners complete **one focused task at a time** in a reliable, repeatable way. Whether you're new to TYPO3 or helping others get started, this is the place to find or contribute learner-first documentation.

**[View the Rendered Guides at docs.typo3.org](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-step-by-step/main/en-us/)**

## 🧭 Why Step-by-Step Guides?

Step-by-step guides are designed for **learning by doing**. Each one:

- Focuses on a single task
- Follows one clear path — no forks or gotchas
- Keeps explanations minimal and actionable
- Produces a visible, successful outcome
- Takes less than 30 minutes to complete
