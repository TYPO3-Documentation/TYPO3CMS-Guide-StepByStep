# Understanding the Primary Structure

Before you write or place a guide, it helps to understand how TYPO3’s step-by-step guides are organized.

You don’t need to read this section to follow a tutorial. But if you’re curious how guides are grouped or why they follow a particular order this is where we explain it.

The TYPO3s step-by-step guides are arranged in a [primary structure](../10Template/Index.md) (from beginner to advanced) and can be organized into **learning paths** that suit different goals and roles, like building a site or becoming an editor.

If you're contributing a new guide, you may want to decide [where in the structure to place the guide](20PlaceGuidesInTheStructure.md). This helps keep things tidy — and helps learners find what they need, when they need it.
